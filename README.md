# Frame Sequence Animation

This project demonstrates a smooth frame-by-frame animation using JavaScript. The animation is driven by user scrolling, creating an engaging and dynamic visual experience. 

## Features

- **Canvas Rendering**: Images are drawn on an HTML canvas element, ensuring smooth and high-quality animation.
- **Scroll-Based Animation**: The animation is controlled by scrolling, using GSAPâ€™s ScrollTrigger for a fluid and responsive user experience.
- **Image Scaling**: Images are scaled to fit the screen while maintaining their aspect ratio, ensuring a consistent visual appearance across different screen sizes.

## Customization
- **Image Sequence**: You can replace the image sequence with your own set of images by placing them in the `cinematic_images` folder and ensuring they follow the same naming convention.
- **Animation Timing**: Adjust the scroll animation timing by modifying the `scrub` value in the GSAP `timeline` configuration.
